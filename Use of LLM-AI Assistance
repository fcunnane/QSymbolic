ðŸ¤– Use of LLM/AI Assistance

Development of this repository included the use of large language model (LLM) tools (e.g., OpenAI ChatGPT) to assist with:
	â€¢	Drafting boilerplate Verilog modules, testbenches, and integration stubs.
	â€¢	Generating documentation summaries, README outlines, and license text.
	â€¢	Brainstorming architectural descriptions and non-confidential explanatory materials.

All code and documentation were reviewed, tested, and curated by QSymbolic LLC.
The use of AI tools does not affect copyright ownership â€” all rights remain with QSymbolic LLC, Francis X. Cunnane III.
