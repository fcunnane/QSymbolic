ROOM: Read-Once-Only Memory (Verilog Reference Implementation)

ROOM (Read-Once-Only Memory) is a post-algebraic, quantum-inspired cryptographic primitive developed by QSymbolic LLC.

Modeled after a quantum measurement enforcing the no-cloning theorem, ROOM ensures that a stored value (e.g., a cryptographic key) 
can be read once only. On the first valid access, the value is released and the register collapses irreversibly within the same clock cycle. 
All subsequent reads return obfuscation (pseudorandom or noise-influenced replacement values).

This repository provides the reference Verilog modules for ROOM as described in the Post-Algebraic Cryptography patent filings.

✨ Key Features
	•	Read-once enforcement — secrets collapse on first qualified read.
	•	Metadata gating — access requires matching basis, phase, tags, or timing.
	•	Collapse latch — same-cycle disable after release.
	•	Obfuscation source — pseudorandom or entropy-derived replacement values.
	•	Peer-linked collapse — entangled cells propagate collapse for group rekeying.
	•	Entropy harvesting — collapse jitter and metastability seed RNGs.

🔒 Security Properties
	•	Post-algebraic & post-quantum: independent of lattice/coding hardness assumptions.
	•	Quantum-inspired: enforces a no-cloning principle at the hardware/software level.
	•	QKD-like intrusion detectability: unauthorized reads collapse secrets into noise, measurable via error rates.
	•	Low power, high efficiency: collapse + KDF cycle costs far less than lattice-based PQC or optical QKD.
	•	Composable: works in FPGA, ASIC, SIM/secure elements, and software.

🛰️ Applications
	•	Mobile / 6G radios — ultra-low-latency ephemeral rekeying.
	•	Satellites & swarms — low-power, high-efficiency key release; peer collapse for group rekey.
	•	Cloud KMS / HSMs — tamper-resistant ephemeral API/tenant keys.
	•	IoT & secure boot — one-time provisioning and firmware authentication.
	•	ZKPs & homomorphic encryption — collapse-backed entropy for protocols.

🤖 Use of LLM/AI Assistance

Development of this repository included the use of large language model (LLM) tools (e.g., OpenAI ChatGPT) to assist with:
	•	Drafting boilerplate Verilog modules, testbenches, and integration stubs.
	•	Generating documentation summaries, README outlines, and license text.
	•	Brainstorming architectural descriptions and non-confidential explanatory materials.

All code and documentation were reviewed, tested, and curated by QSymbolic LLC.
